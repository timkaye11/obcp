Description: This R package does bayesian online changepoint detection using the algorithm outlined in Adams and Mackay (2008). 
  The algorithm takes in a time series object, and returns an S3 object containing the probabilistic changepoint locations, and other 
  attributes. This function assumes that the data is normally distributed, as it uses the normal inverse-gamma distribution as the prior distribution. 
Depends: R (>= 3.1.2)
