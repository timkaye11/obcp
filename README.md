## Online Bayesian Change-point Detection in R

This algorithm is based off the paper written by ![Adams and Mackay](https://hips.seas.harvard.edu/files/adams-changepoint-tr-2007.pdf). 

Essentially, given time-series data, this package detects changepoints (i.e instances where the mean or the variance changed) using the Bayesian framework. 

## TODO
 - add a quick example
 - functionality for other distributions, besides normal-inverse-gamma
